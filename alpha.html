            <p>Alpha Flight Commander: Katherine Tat<br>
            tkatherine2003@gmail.com<br>(858) 322-9144<br>Hello! I am c/2nd Lt. Katherine Tat and your Alpha Flight commander. Throughout the past few years, I have been a member of the Unarmed Fancy Drill Team, a Kitty Hawk Tutor, a member of the Awareness Presentation Team and Stellar Xplorers, and the 2018 BDIY. Outside of AFJROTC, I am an active member of the Teen Council, a library volunteer, and a poet. Junior ROTC is a program that offers many opportunities to grow as a student, cadet, leader, and citizen; I hope you will take advantage of as many as you can. Feel free to talk to me about anything (drilling, knowledge, school, etc.)! Iâ€™m so excited to meet and motivate you throughout this outstanding year!</p>

            patrick.m.ngo@gmail.com <br>(858) 610-1281<br>Hi everyone! I am c/TSgt Patrick Ngo and I am the Alpha Flight Sergeant for the 2019-2020 school year. In my time at the CA-935 unit, I have participated in Cyberpatriot, Academic Bowl Team, Saber Team, Kitty Hawk, and Logistics. Outside of the unit, I enjoy competing in Model United Nations, Science Olympiad, National Oceanographic Science Bowl, and Tennis Team, and I additionally coach Science Olympiad and Academic Bowl for Marshall Middle School. My hobbies include origami, piano, and spending time with my friends. As the Alpha Flight and Cyber Patriot Sergeant, I look forward to sharing my knowledge and experience as being an SRHS student and cadet with everyone!</p>
