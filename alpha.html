            <p>Alpha Flight Commander: Jessica Tuey<br>
                <a href="mailto: jessicaktuey@gmail.com">jessicaktuey@gmail.com</a><br>(858)-688-4599<br>What's up, I'm c/2dLt Jessica Tuey and I will be your Alpha Flight Commander as well as your Academic Bowl Commander for this year! I'm a senior at SRHS and this is my fourth and final year in AFJROTC. Within our unit, I am a part of the Saber Fancy Drill Team, Youth Physical Fitness Team, Kitty Hawk Tutoring, Academic Bowl, and Logistics (formerly). This program has given me so many opportunities to be confident, take the initiative, meet new people, and stand out. Everyone is very helpful, respectful, and welcoming-- you've probably heard it before and I'll say it again: RO really is a big family. Within SRHS, I'm also a part of the Academic League and a variety of other clubs. In what little free time I have, I am most likely doing one of the following: kung fu (I'm a soon-to-be black belt in constant physical pain), getting boba, hanging out with friends, making art (hmu if you want customized clothing;)), cruising around on my skateboard, or sleeping. Probably sleeping, honestly. But regardless of where I am or what I'm up to, feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or concerns, or if you just need a shoulder to lean on. Life's rough, especially since COVID is a thing, and if there's anything I can do to make it easier for you, let me know ♡⊂(▀¯▀⊂)</p>

            <p>Alpha Flight Sergeant: Racel Ligeralde<br>
                <a href="mailto: radicalracie@gmail.com">radicalracie@gmail.com</a> <br>(858)-695-4025<br>Heyy, what’s up guys?! Name’s c/TSgt Racel Ligeralde. But you can just call me RC, and I’m the sergeant for Alpha Flight for this school year. I’m an incoming sophomore and have been in the program for a year. Even still, this program is a true home and family. I’m on the Flag Detail Team, APT, part of Logistics, and Public Affairs. Outside of JROTC, I’m a part of Scripps’ theatre program: Falcon Playhouse and ASB. So, you’re likely to see me hanging around the campus bonding with people. Coming into a high school where I knew no one, I never had true confidence in myself. However, as a result of JROTC instilling in me self-confidence, I now feel good about myself and am able to trust others as well. If I know what true happiness means now, it’s because of this program. Therefore, I’m definitely looking forward to a new and exciting year. Feel free to contact me if you have questions or just wanna chat about ANYTHING. Seriously, I absolutely love talking to people so I promise, no judgement. Also, I’m the tiniest member of Operations but I’m also a roast queen, so I’ll always have your back as I’m a VERY loyal cadet. I hope I can give y’all the same experiences and unforgettable memories RO has brought me. WE GOT THIS MY LOVES! <3333</p>
