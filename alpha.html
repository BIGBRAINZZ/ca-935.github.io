            <p>Alpha Flight Commander: Abel Hurtado<br>
                <a href="mailto: abelhurt13@gmail.com">abelhurt13@gmail.com</a><br>(228)-235-1675<br>Yeehaw, â€˜sup yâ€™all? My nameâ€™s c/2nd Lt. Abel Hurtado, but yâ€™all already knew that. Iâ€™m the Alpha Flight Commander for the 2020-2021 AY! Iâ€™ve been vibing in RO for 4 years now, and if thereâ€™s one thing I know other than clutching Gulag, itâ€™s that RO is very radical. I started out as a semi-unreliable cadet during my freshman year, but after some time, RO showed me that I could be more than just a circus clown and part-time epic gamer. RO became my home away from home, and by Odinâ€™s beard I wish I could stay forever. When Iâ€™m not down in the battlefield known as SRHS, commanding my flight, Iâ€™m either watching YouTube videos, playing COD Warzone with the homies, or sleeping till I remember I have homework to do. Iâ€™m also a member of the Unarmed Fancy Drill Team, so if youâ€™re ever considering a team to join later on, I better see your beautiful faces there, I mean it! >:( Iâ€™ll be coming after you if you donâ€™t! Need help with drill? Assistance with sounding-off? Need someone to help you rob a bank? Hit me up, letâ€™s get down to business. I look forward to meeting you all! As always, make it an oUtStAnDiNg day, or not, the choice is yours! ðŸ¤ ðŸ””</p>

            <p>Alpha Flight Sergeant: Pahel Srivastava<br>
                <a href="mailto: pahel.srivastava@gmail.com">pahel.srivastava@gmail.com</a> <br>(---) --- ----<br>Hi everyone! Iâ€™m c/TSgt Pahel Srivastava, and Iâ€™m the Alpha flight sergeant for the 2020-2021 school year! In ROTC, I do CyberPatriot, Logistics, and Iâ€™m on the Unarmed Fancy Drill Team (yes UFDT is the best drill team). Outside of ROTC, I do a lot of STEM activities. Last year, I participated in three robotics competitions, Science Olympiad, and other STEM related initiatives. Among all of my extracurriculars, there is one thing in common: I love talking to people! Whether it is communicating with students overseas as part of my STEM initiative, or talking to ROTC cadets, I can probably chew anyoneâ€™s ears off! As the Alpha flight sergeant I look forward to talking to each and every one of you and turning our flight into a family. You can talk to me about absolutely anything. If a flight sergeant canâ€™t do pushups, you have absolutely nothing to be embarrassed of around me  ðŸ™‚ Side note: Abel actually isnâ€™t as intimidating as everyone thinks he is.</p>
