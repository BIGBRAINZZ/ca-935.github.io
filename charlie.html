            <p>Charlie Flight Commander: Thu Vu <br>
            Helloitsthu@gmail.com<br>(858) 252-9003<br>Hello. Welcome. I am c/2nd Lieutenant Thu Vu and it is my absolute honor to be the Charlie Flight Commander for the 2019-2020 school year. I have been in AFJROTC for 3 years (going into my fourth) and besides my role in the operations squadron this year, I have had experience as a Public Affairs NCO and have also took the position as the 1st ever Education Commander in the unit. I have also been part of  the Unarmed Fancy Drill Team, Stellarxplorers, Kitty Hawk, and as a Logistic representative. I usually don't have much free time but whenever I do, I like to bake, jam out to some music, play my violin, read, playing games, and hang out with my friends. Oh, and I can't forget my favorite hobby of "sleeping". I'm excited to work with my sergeant, c/Tsgt Christina Nguyen, this year and see what is in store for our flight and cadets. If there are any questions, comments, or if you just want to be friends, please feel free to find me in the grinder during lunch or contact me through my email or phone number. Thank you for taking the time to visit my page :)

            christinan2004@gmail.com<br> (619) 791-9957<br>Hello everyone!! I am c/TSgt. Christina Nguyen and the Charlie Flight Sergeant for this year! This is my second year in AFJROTC, and my time in the program has been wonderful. I’ve made many friends from it, and have also learned a lot of useful life skills from it too. Besides being a flight sergeant, I am also a member of the Unarmed Fancy Drill Team and was part of PA last year! Some hobbies of mine are, playing the piano and drawing. I am super excited for this year, and can’t wait to meet everyone!! Feel free to come to me anytime for help or for any questions you have. I look forward to having an outstanding year with you all!!
