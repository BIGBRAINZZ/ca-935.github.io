            mrcustodio1@gmail.com<br>(858)208-9797<br>Hiya everyone! I’m c/2nd lt Matthew Custodio and I am your Charlie Flight Commander as well as your Armed Fancy Drill Team Commander! I absolutely love this program so much and it means so much to me to be with so many wonderful people! In my free time, I love spending it on watching my favorite shows being anime or kdramas hehehe but I mostly enjoy going out fishing with my family. It is certainly a pleasure to be working with everyone and I am most definitely excited to be serving all of you this year!

I am a member UFDT, the 2018 BDY, a former member of APT (2017-2018) and always looking for new friends. Outside of JROTC I am the president of the Poetry Club and an active member of Teen Council. I enjoy writing poetry, playing piano, running and hiking in my spare time. Feel free to talk to me about anything (drilling, knowledge, advice, school, life, etc.).  I’m so excited to meet and motivate you all throughout this amazing year! ;)
