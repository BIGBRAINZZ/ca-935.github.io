            <p>Charlie Flight Commander: Lucky Hong<br>
            <a href = "mailto: ejeffeljohnbuan24@gmail.com">ejeffeljohnbuan24@gmail.com</a><br>(858)-408-5970<br>Howdy gamers, I'm c/2Lt Lucky Hong, and this is my third year in RO. I am incredibly grateful that I've been chosen as a flight commander, and I will do my best to make help this corp succeed. Within RO, I'm on Armed, Public Affairs, and was on Logistics. This unit is truly one of a kind, and if you put in the effort you can achieve a lot here. In my free time, I like to play and hate all the Riot Games, I especially enjoy and despise playing League of Legends. I also enjoy listening to Asian hip-hop, solving Rubik's Cubes, and messing around with photography/videography. I also love learning about languages, I speak Cantonese, Mandarin, and Vietnamese (some better than others), so feel free to try to talk to me in those languages. If you ever need help, don't hesitate to reach out to me, whether it be about RO or just general stuff. Can't wait to meet all of you so we can have a wonderful year!
P.S. If you ever want to insult someone just tell them, 生舊叉燒好過生你

            <p>Charlie Flight Sergeant: JJ O'Connell<br>
          <a href = "mailto: jphamca@yahoo.com">jphamca@yahoo.com</a><br>(858) 603-8623<br>Greetings, inhabitants of earth. I’m c/MSgt JJ O’Connell, and I’m this year’s Charlie flight sergeant! I’m a sophomore this year, and I absolutely love being in JROTC! I’ve made some of my closest friends and most valuable memories. I’m part of StellarXplorers (of which I’m the SNCO for), Armed Team, Academic League, Public Affairs, and formerly Logistics. Every single one of these and so much more essentially made my freshman year. This program truly is extremely impactful. I’ve changed so much from where I was years ago, and in the best ways possible. You don’t have to join everything you see, but it’s important to stay open minded! Never turn down an opportunity without thinking about it. Outside of JROTC, I’m an avid musician of rock and metal, baseball fan (GO PADRES), and the world’s worst fisherman. I’m always available for a conversation, whether that be assistance or just a chat for no reason other than boredom. Remember to take advantage of the chances you’ll get to better yourself, and be the ultimate giga-chad champ that you are >:) \m/ 
P.S. Andres is a nerd and also a Chargers fan (Yeah, I guess they do exist)
