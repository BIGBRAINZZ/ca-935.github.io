            <p>Golf Flight Commander: Thomas Phan <br>
            Thomasphan5063@gmail.com<br>(858)408-5063<br>Hello Everyone! I’m c/2nd Lt. Thomas Phan and I am the Golf Flight Commander as well as the Armed Team Sergeant this year. This is my third year being in AFJROTC and as you can tell, I did not regret joining this program. I hope to be a mentor as well as your friend so don’t hesitate to talk to me if you need help with anything! Outside of AFJROTC, I am also the club president of VSA (Vietnamese Student Association) so I hope to see some familiar faces when clubs begin! Outside of school, I like to kayak, eat sushi, travel, and play just about any sport. I look forward to having an amazing year with everyone and getting to know you all!

            <p>Golf Flight Sergeant: Xavier dela Cruz <br>
            xkdelacruz831@gmail.com<br>My name is c/TSgt Xavier dela Cruz, I am the Golf flight Sergeant. I am a member of the Armed Drill team and I am a second year.  I joined AFJROTC kind of scared of the new environment but I got accustomed to all the great people really fast, my flight commander and sergeant were the best, I was influenced the most by them. I fell in love with the Ops squadron and AFJROTC in general. I’ll be the guy you first turn to when you have a problem. Don’t worry, I’ll do my best to help! Outside of this wonderful program I am a stay-at-home son. I cook (to the best of my ability), and garden (also to the best of my ability) with my dad and my brother. I like going on walks around the neighborhood in the evening and am currently working on my own comic book. I hope to have an awesome year with you all!
