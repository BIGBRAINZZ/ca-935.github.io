            <p>Foxtrot Flight Commander:  Xavier dela Cruz <br>
            xkdelacruz831@gmail.com<br>(858) 226-3101<br>Hidey ho everybody, my name is c/2nd Lt Xavier dela Cruz. I’ll be your Foxtrot flight commander for this year. I am so grateful to be here as an officer after 3 whole years in this awesome program and I look forward to working with y’all. Just a quick autobio from me is all you’ll need, feel free to just pull me to the side to chat, I’m a pretty open guy. Anyways, I was a short, shy kid not too long ago. Making dumb jokes with my friends, playing smash, and drawing comics. When I first came into this corps, it changed my life. It was all thanks to people around me, like the wonderful operations squadron and the just as wonderful Armed drill team. I hope I can be of great service to you and maybe change YOUR life, for the better obviously. I look forward to the future with you all!

            jusnguyen1@gmail.com<br>(858) 280-5021<br>Hello, my name is c/TSgt Justin Nguyen, and I will be the one and only Foxtrot flight sergeant for the 2019-2020 school year. In the corps, I am a 2nd year cadet, and part of the Armed Fancy Drill Team. Outside of school, I enjoy playing video games like League of Legends and World War 3, and watching Twitch streamers like Ninja, oh wait, xQc :D. I hardly turn down an opportunity to game or just talk with a friend, so feel free to hit me up. During this school year, I hope to help you magnificent beasts grow as leaders, succeed in the corp, succeed in high school, and prepare you for your future. I look forward to the vic roys and epic gamer moments the 2019-2020 Foxtrot flight will secure!
