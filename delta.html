            <p>Delta Flight Commander: Brandy Opondo <br>
             bneema2001@gmail.com<br>(619) 718-2818<br>What is up, my dudes! I’m c/2nd Lt. Brandy Opondo but you can call me anytime *wink wink*.  I am the Delta Flight Commander for this school year. I am also a senior so by the end of this year, my 4-year prison sentence will be done! I’m kidding, I’m kidding (not really though). I am a part of our corps’ very own Armed Fancy Drill Team (at least for now lol).  I love all things music (singing, playing, listening). My favorite band is the one, the only ONE DIRECTION! I play the flute. I listen to all types of music INCLUDING country. But not like country country, like pop country. If you ever see me around school, please don’t be afraid to come and talk to me. I’m not scary I swear it’s just my face. I’m super nice and I would love to get to know you or at least learn your names. Feel free to hit me up on the gram @_opanda_ . I’m looking forward to this year and I hope you are too!

            <p>Delta Flight Sergeant: Philip Sargent <br>
            philipsargent005@gmail.com<br>(314) 705-7749<br>Hey all, I’m c/TSgt Philip Sargent (call me “Sergeant Sargent”, “Sergeant Squared”, or basically anything else you can think of), I’m a sophomore here at SRHS, and I’m super excited to lead you as your Delta Flight Sergeant this year! Throughout my life as a Navy child, I’ve lived in 5 different places around the country, and moved to San Diego in 2017. I am a member of the CA-935 Academic Bowl team, as well as SRHS Academic League outside of AFJROTC. When I’m not procrastinating on AP Euro notes, I sing baritone in Chamber Bravura, a San Diego-based youth acapella choir, I’m currently teaching myself ukulele, and I love to eat copious masses of food, watch movies, bike, jam to music you’ve never heard of, and eat more copious amounts of food. Don’t be afraid to come up to me with any questions, concerns, and especially memes;) My #1 goal for this year is to give YOU the opportunities you need to better yourself as a team member and leader! (Also I gotta rep my IG, @phil.sgt )
