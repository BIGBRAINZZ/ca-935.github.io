            <p>Delta Flight Commander: Joshua Pagaduan <br>
             j3pag280@gmail.com<br>(619) 496-2259<br>What’s up cuties, I’m c/2nd Lt. Joshua Pagaduan, and I’ll be this year’s Delta Flight Commander. Some of my interests include: anime, video games, pop culture, tiktok, breaking (bboying), and playing the ukulele. Outside of ROTC, I’m the publicity manager for CLWM (search up @clwm.clwm on ig), a member of our badminton team, and I’m a part of the spirit committee for our school’s Key Club. Like many of you, back on that first fateful day at CLC, I was really scared and unsure of how all these people would react to me. Would they like me? Would they hate me? Am I good enough? However, throughout my time here, I started to grow and learn. I started to really understand what it meant to contribute to something greater than yourself. If you’re one of those scared and nervous cadets, like I was so many years ago, take a chance, and put yourself out there. It’s scary. Believe me, I know. But, worst case scenario, you don’t like it, and switch to PE, walking laps around the track for hours. Best case scenario, you make 200+ new friends, only have to workout twice a week, get to put it on your college apps (they like commitment), and make a whole lot of memories.

            <p>Delta Flight Sergeant: Hilary Nguyen <br>
            hi.04.nguyen@gmail.com<br>(858) 281-1040<br>Hey, ya’ll~!  It’s c/TSgt Hilary Nguyen: an ARMY, a self-proclaimed Libra, and the flight sergeant for Delta Flight!  This is my second year in AFJROTC, but the program and the people in it have given me so much--could you spare a few years for me to list it all out?  From escaping the torrential downpour under a Tweety Bird blanket to watching that dusty ol’ football soar into the end zone, this program has given me so many precious memories and radiant opportunities.  I really wish I took more of those last year.  Learn from my choices: step outside of your bubble!  You’ll discover new friends, new passions, a new identity.  We’re aiming for growth here, people!  Please feel free to reach out to me; I’m hyped to get to know all of you!  Let’s get this SLICED bread!!!  (∩ ⌃ヮ⌃)⊃━━☆ﾟ♪.*･｡ﾟ♫
