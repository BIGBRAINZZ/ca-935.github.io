            <p>Delta Flight Commander: Christian Yoon <br>
             cky2003florida@gmail.com<br>(619) 496-2259<br>Come with me, let’s take a trip, you won't regret it. It was the 7th hour of sol 29 of the 6th month of the 2003th year when a beautiful boy was born. He was a little strange and a little chubby. He would go through happy times and sad times, make good choices and bad ones, and one good decision he made in particular was joining JROTC. He would become a musician, a public speaker, and a mighty man of character. I, c/2nd Lt Christian Yoon. am. that. man. I look forward to a great year of more life lessons and self improvement from the amazing people in our cool corps, and I will do my best to bring a little something back to you too. To those who may be intimidated to talk to me, don't worry, after all these years, I still am a little strange and a little chubby. I hope to hear your story soon.

            j3pag280@gmail.com<br>(858) 281-1040<br>Hello everyone, I’m c/TSgt Joshua Pagaduan, and I will be your Delta Flight Sergeant for this year! In my free time, I enjoy breakdancing, playing basketball, and playing the ukulele. I enjoy playing video games, watching anime and listening to all types of music. I am a member of the Unarmed Fancy Drill Team, and was a member of PA Staff. I also competed on our team for BDP. My goal is to help YOU succeed and grow as a person, the same way that this program has helped me. Feel free to ask me any questions you may have regarding ROTC or if you just need a friend to talk to, I’m always happy to listen. I look forward to an amazing year with all the outstanding cadets in this program.
