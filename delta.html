            <a href = "mailto: j3pag280@gmail.com">j3pag280@gmail.com</a><br>(858)-722-3191<br>Hiiiii everyone!! I’m c/2nd Lt Lea Chanthaluxay (yes I know my last name is complicated) and I am the flight commander for Delta Flight for the 2021-2022 school year!! I am unfortunately a senior this year so this is my last year here. So I am also the Flag Detail Commander so please try out for the team when the tryouts start!!!! I am part of the Youth Physical Fitness Team and Saber Fancy Drill Team. If you ever find me outside of school, I am likely drinking boba or skateboarding all over San Diego. I am a Peer Tutor and teacher’s aide for American Sign Language! And obviously I am a huge fan of many sports. Anyways, here’s a little bit of advice; time flies by with high school so please make the most of all the moments. I am always here for advice or if you ever just need a friend!! Anyways, LETS GO FLEX ON THOSE OTHER SCHOOLS!!!! <3

            <p>Delta Flight Sergeant: Hilary Nguyen <br>
            <a href = "mailto: hi.04.nguyen@gmail.com">hi.04.nguyen@gmail.com</a><br>What’s up whoever’s reading this, c/TSgt Tyler Hong here, and I’m the Delta sergeant for this year. Previously in my life, I did taekwondo and tennis, but ever since covid, I’ve been finding new things to do. I’ve been in the program for one year, which was arguably not even a full year of school, but still a fun one. The program so far has brought me great joy, as I’ve met many wonderful people along my journey. However, the single best thing that the program has brought me to is the glorious armed team. If you ever went to Dingeman this summer and spotted a guy with a rifle, chances are that was me. Apart from my life in RO, I don’t do much besides league, besides maybe watching random vids. If you have any questions about flight, armed team, or want advice on anything, feel free to ask me.
