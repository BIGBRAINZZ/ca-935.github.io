			<p> Hello cadets, parents, staff, and visitors! My name is Jessica Pham and I am the Group Commander of the 2021-22 school year. As the Group Commander, I oversee the other eight members of our unitâ€™s Senior Staff as well as work with the ASI and administration to ensure nothing but excellence in the unit. I am honored to be able to serve such an amazing program, but more importantly, I am excited to learn and grow to become a better patriot, leader, and wingman along with my cadets. </p>
			
			<p> Going into highschool, I was set on doing great things but was unsure of how to go about them. I had motivation with no direction. When I joined JROTC, a hundred doors opened for me. Ever since then, I have learned to speak for what matters with our Awareness Presentation Team. I have felt the thudding of rifles in unison with our Armed Team. I have worked through frustrating challenges as a team in our CyberPatriot. Every experience, from flight days to competition days, has each taught me something about confidence, initiative, and altruism. My goal is for all of our cadets to also be able to come out of this program with new experiences, valuable lessons, and a clear direction to bring into their future career and beyond.
			</p>
			
			<p>Last year, the world was turned upside down. The structure and systems we had depended on were taken away from us. But we are no strangers to challenge. We adapted to stay connected in a virtual world, we found ways to have the same exciting events, and we kept the momentum moving. Even with any uncertainties that may lie ahead, I am sure we will break many new boundaries, as we have proven time and time again. </p>
			
			<p>I am thrilled for everything in store this year, and I look forward to opening new doors with our cadets!</p>
