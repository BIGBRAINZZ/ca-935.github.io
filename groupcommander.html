			<p>Hi everyone,</p>
			<p>I’m cadet Colonel Valerie Ho, a senior this year at Scripps Ranch High School and the group commander for 
				our Air Force Junior ROTC program for the 2018-2019 school year. </p>
			<p>Our unit is known for sustained success across a wide variety of fields, whether that be academics, drill,
				or physical fitness, and it is a direct result of our instructors being the best demonstrations of 
				the “whole person concept” for us to emulate. Not only are we encouraged to be academically strong, 
				we are challenged to take our knowledge to the next level and be ready to express our views in a 
				compelling way to anyone around us. But along with being open-minded and critical thinkers, we also 
				pride ourselves in our ability to adapt and overcome whatever obstacles are thrown our way, whether 
				those obstacles come in the form of extended construction, altered timelines, or even changes to our 
				“traditional” regulation standards. We make do with what we have, and practice through mental, physical,
				and emotional fatigue until we KNOW we’ve exhausted ourselves to our limits. </p>
			<p>I am extremely proud to lead a unit that has proven itself time and time again to be strong--morally, 
				mentally, and physically. Our cadets work tirelessly to put themselves at the very top, and that 
				is clear through how they readily examine failures and use those learned lessons to continue working
				at what they hope to achieve. Our program is great not merely because of the high standards we are 
				held to, but because of the caliber of cadets that join us -- they are genuine, selfless, and determined
				down to their very core. Many of my greatest mentors and role models have been the very cadets around me 
				who constantly seek improvement for themselves and all those around them.</p>
			<p>I look forward to spending time with each of you at all our unit events… please come talk to myself and the 
				Senior Staff any chance you get. We as a staff will try our absolute hardest to make sure 2018-2019 is 
				a year that goes in the books! </p>
