			<p>Hello everyone, </p>
			<p>I am Cadet Colonel Matthew Custodio and I am the Group Commander for Scripps Ranch High School’s Air Force 
				JROTC program during the 2019-2020 school year.</p>
			<p>Our program has attained many accolades that merely define the success that we thrive for here in CA-935th. 
				Through the myriad of opportunities in AFJROTC, each and every cadet can engross themselves into the 
				dedicated Drill Teams, the brilliant Academic Bowl team, the adept CyberPatriot team, and many more.
				By challenging each and every cadet to their limits, everyone will constantly learn, grow, and improve. 
				Starting with the individual cadet, our program strives to develop character among all of our cadets and
				make them better versions of themselves everyday. Choosing to focus on our cadets creates the base for 
				impeccable leadership. As cadets gain knowledge as followers, they will become leaders who will educate
				and influence others in the future. Garnering the mentality of camaraderie and teamwork instills the 
				emotions that our unit is ONE unit and that we are ONE family. </p>
			<p>It is truly an honor for me to be leading a well rounded group of individuals who are not only talented and 
				brilliant but also extremely diligent and hard working. It is a fact that with all of our program’s 
				achievements and acknowledgements that it is due to our cadets for putting in so much work. Without 
				our cadets, our program would not have the reputation that we have today. If we fall, fail, or make 
				mistakes, we will adapt, learn, and strengthen ourselves so that we rise, succeed, and carry on. </p>
			<p>I am super glad to be serving you as your Group Commander and also creating fond memories together with 
				everyone! I look forward to meeting each and every one of you! If you have any questions or concerns 
				or just want to chat, my Senior Staff and I will gladly be there every step of the way. Let us all
				work together and make sure 2019-2020 is 
				a year that goes in the books! </p>
