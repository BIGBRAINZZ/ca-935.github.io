            <p>Scripps Ranch High School’s Air Force Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFJROTC) CA 935th program, has been the number one JROTC unit in the San Diego Unified School District for many years. We value hard-work, friendship, and achievement, pushing our cadets not only to be their best but also to perform their best.</p>
	        <p>Cadets have the opportunity to develop their leadership skills, through joining a drill or academic team or through individual competitions, and many cadets, as upperclassmen, hold positions that require great leadership and responsibility. They are all leaders among their peers, and they continue to grow in a place where they belong, excel and are rewarded.</p>
            <p>Cadets also have access to a positive educational experience in which their immediate and highest priority is to graduate high school and pursue higher educational opportunities. AFJROTC teaches the important values of citizenship, self-esteem, self-discipline, self-respect, service to the community, pride in belonging and personal, family and social responsibility with aims to instill these values beyond high school. Cadets also learn drill and ceremonies, as well as aviation/space technology in the program.<p>

<p>Below are some of our proudest achievements that we have earned through teamwork, hard-work and dedication:</p>
