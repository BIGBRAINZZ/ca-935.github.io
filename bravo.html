            <p>Bravo Flight Commander: Marcus Velasquez <br>
                <a href="mailto: marcusvelasquez132@gmail.com">marcusvelasquez132@gmail.com</a><br>(858)-610-4382<br><p>Hello, everyone! I am c/2nd Lt. Marcus Velasquez and I am Bravo Flight’s Flight Commander for this year! I’ve been in this program since I was a freshman and I can honestly say that high school is much better because of it. Every day I walk into class (or join the Zoom call), I can’t help but feel the camaraderie and teamwork that unites us all together. It’s a warm, fuzzy feeling that can only be matched by a rainy Saturday night when you have no homework to take care of and all of the boys are online. The choice for me was simple: either do PE (boring, unoriginal, and 99% not PE), or join RO, learn some life skills, make friends, and do actual PE. Long story short, here I am, with an awesome flight and an equally awesome flight sergeant! In addition to this job, I am also a member of the StellarXplorers team, which is the closest you can get to Space Force JROTC. When I’m not in school, you can find me gaming, watching YouTube, playing my saxophone, or ignoring my alarm. My proverbial door is open at any time (except to those who own a dog named Jersey and like Weezer), so feel free to ask if you need help for things like studying knowledge, fixing your uniform, or preparing to join a team. I’m looking forward to working with you all this year!</p>

                         <a href="mailto: hkquinn3@gmail.com">hkquinn3@gmail.com</a><br>(603)-438-6657<br>Hey guys! I’m c/TSgt Haleigh Quinn and I am the Bravo Flight Sergeant for the 2020-2021 school year! This is my second year in the AFJROTC program and I absolutely love it!! Ever since I’ve joined this program I have learned many valuable lessons and found a second family. Other than being a flight sergeant, I am also a member of Armed Fancy Drill Team and the Security Team. I recently moved to California just about a year ago and I was super shy and very quiet. Moving here impacted my life so much because I have met so many different types of people and was able to become more of an outgoing person. I have moved around all my life so I am always down to try new things! I also love to hang out with my friends, going to the beach, and just being outside in general. Please take advantage of all of the amazing opportunities this program has to offer.  If you ever need help in AFJROTC or anything (or you need a boba buddy;)) I’m just a text or email away.I am so excited to meet you all and work with an amazing flight commander! P.S Foxtrot Flight Sergeant’s real name is Hucky Long and he has an android.</p>
