            <p>Bravo Flight Commander: Hilary Nguyen <br>
                <a href="mailto: hi.04.nguyen@gmail.com">hi.04.nguyen@gmail.com</a><br><p>Hey, y’all~!  It’s c/2dLt Hilary Nguyen: an ARMY, an astrology enthusiast, and the flight commander for Bravo Flight!  I’m also on APT, Kitty Hawk, and Flag Detail.  Three years in AFJROTC have given me so many precious memories—from escaping the torrential downpour under a Tweety Bird blanket to watching my first-years win Tapout at CLC.  Outside of RO, I’m a CSF Officer, the NHS Secretary, and a Girl Scout.  High school is all about discovering yourself, so try out for everything you can and infiltrate all the clubs!  If y’all have any questions or wanna talk about anything whatsoever, please feel free to reach out to me; I probably know a guy who knows a guy, and I’m hyped to get to know all of you!  Let’s get this SLICED bread, my little chickpeas!!! (∩ ⌃ヮ⌃)⊃━━☆ﾟ♪.*･｡ﾟ♫</p>

            <p>Bravo Flight Sergeant: Andres Palacio <br>
                         <a href="mailto:ajpr1910@gmail.com">ajpr1910@gmail.com</a><br>(858)201-8572<br>Hey guys! I’m c/TSgt Andres Palacios, and I’ll be the flight sergeant for Bravo flight! I’m an incoming sophomore and while I haven’t truly experienced RO, I know it’s going to be amazing this year! Coming into RO I was definitely much more timid and shy than now (hence why I didn’t join any teams) but I’ve come out of my shell way more thanks to the program! Now, not only am I a flight sergeant but also your Comptroller NCO because I’ve seized the opportunity given to me by Senior Staff to take two positions whereas before I’d be too insecure in my abilities to handle it. I do very little outside of RO, just MUN, but I’m a huge history buff (not nerd as SOME other sergeants would have you believe cough cough) and always down to talk about it, whether it’s to explain something or learn new things! In fact, if you need help with anything just contact me and I will give it my best shot!</p>
