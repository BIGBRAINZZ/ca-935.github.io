            <p>Bravo Flight Commander: Samantha Scotchlas <br>
            samantha.scotchlas@gmail.com<br>(858)-999-4625<br>Hi everybody! I am c/2nd Lt. Samantha Scotchlas and I’m  super excited to be this year’s Bravo Flight Commander! I can’t wait to meet each and every one in the corps! In my previous years, I was a member of Awareness Presentation Team, Flag Detail Team, a Kitty Hawk Tutor, and on the Youth Physical Fitness Team. I am also a competitive swimmer(both for Pacific Swim Club and SRHS Swim), pianist, and Girl Scout working on my Gold Award. I am a very friendly and helpful person who strives to be organized and productive. I am open to any/all questions and friendships— especially if they involve food(pasta and avocados are my favorite hehe)!! Again, I’m incredibly excited to help others reach their FULL potential! :)

            <p>Bravo Flight Sergeant: Marcus Velasquez <br>
            marcusvelasquez132@gmail.com<br>(858)-610-4382<br>Hey, what's up guys, c/TSgt. Marcus Velasquez here, and I’m looking forward to being Bravo Flight’s sergeant this year! Ever since I joined the corps, I’ve made countless friends and learned a whole lot from the program. Apart from being a flight sergeant, I am also the StellarXplorers sergeant along with Echo’s Flight Sergeant, Rutva. I’m also a member of Armed Team and Kittyhawk, RO’s in-house tutoring program. If you look past my horrible smile (I got nervous and forgot how to show human emotion), you’ll see that I’m an average fellow who enjoys gaming, sleeping, and reading up on the latest in space exploration or computer hardware. I also know Japanese, play the saxophone, and practice martial arts! I may be a little on the shy side, but I’ll be sure I am able to answer your questions or offer help when you need it. Be seeing you around!
Fun Fact One: the Hotel Flight Sergeant plays Heavy because he doesn't know how else to counter Pyro. 
Fun fact Two: whatever the Hotel Flight Sergeant says about me is false.
