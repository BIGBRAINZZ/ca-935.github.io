Good afternoon!

The Air Commando Association (ACA) is looking for a few outstanding senior AFJROTC cadets to apply for two scholarships in 2021. The Ray Bourque Service and Lt Col Dave Krebs High Flight scholarships are for senior cadetsâ€™ use after their high school graduation and must be applied for NLT 31 March of their graduation year to be awarded by 30 April of the same year. Funds to be distributed to the school no later than 31 July.

The Ray Bourque scholarship in the amount of $2,000 and the Lt Col Dave Krebs High Flight scholarship in the amount of $4,000 are to be spent on college expenses according to cadet eligibility requirements.
