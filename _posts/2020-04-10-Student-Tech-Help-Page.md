Scripps Ranch High School has launched a student tech help page that is supposed to get students up and running with setup help and access to other learning sites.


It is meant to be simple:

 *   Google How to's
 *   Web-based learning tools
 *   Using Chrome extensions on their Chromebooks.

The link is [here](https://sites.google.com/sandi.net/srhs-student-help-page/home), and you can also find it on the school website under "for students". Please note that you have to be signed in to your school account to access it, it will provide a 404 error otherwise.
