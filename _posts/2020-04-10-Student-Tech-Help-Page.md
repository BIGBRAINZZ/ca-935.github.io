Scripps Ranch High School has launched a student tech help page that is supposed to get students up and running with setup help and access to other learning sites.


It is meant to be simple:

 *   Google How to's
 *   Web-based learning tools
 *   Using Chrome extensions on their Chromebooks.

The link is [here](https://sites.google.com/sandi.net/srhs-student-help-page/home), and you can also find it on the school website under "for students".
