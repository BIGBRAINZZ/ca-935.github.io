Here's a a message from c/Capt Mackenzie Trinh!

This month we will be participating in two community service events:

The Chalk Walk Event (March 8th-March 31st)
The purpose of this project is to spread positive messages using chalk, and help destigmatize mental health, while maintaining a Covid-safe environment.

The CFL Recycling Drive (March 8th- March 26th)
Covers For Lives plans on collecting bottles and cans to raise money to purchase packs of travel sized shampoo. 100% of all profits will be donated to the SDUSD.
