Good evening! This is a reminder that we have a Senior Staff Q/A Panel tommorow from 1330 to 1430 on MSgt. Toledo's Zoom code. You can come and ask us anything about our jobs, or anything you'd like to ask in general. If you're interested in a Senior Staff position, if you're on the fence, or even if you don't know at all, we highly encourage you to come, because your mind might change or you might learn something useful! Be there or (be)^2

-c/Capt. Justin Bui
