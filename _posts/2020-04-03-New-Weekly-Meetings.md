As of now, we will be having Zoom meetings (SASI/ASI All Call meetings), every Monday beginning at April 6 at 1400. These meetings will be for all cadets who would like to stay informed/ask questions to the instructors/Senior Staff. The meeting will open at 1330 for casual socializing, the meeting will begin at 1400 when the instructors join and last to 1430, with 1430-1500 being for casual socializing again. Hope to see you there!
