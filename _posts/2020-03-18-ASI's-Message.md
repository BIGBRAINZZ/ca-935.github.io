Please read this letter from our ASI.

I want to take a minute to say a huge thank you to all of you.  As I sit at home with my family watching all the news and information of COVID-19 coming in from all over the world, I’ve had time to reflect and process all the things that have been effected not just in my personal life but also all of yours as well.

As students/cadets, you have seen so much of your lives canceled for the time being - no school, no JROTC Ball, no drill comps, no base visits, no sports, no college visits, no SAT, no socializing in person.

Although disappointing to say the least, please know that LIFE IS NOT CANCELLED and each of you still have many things to look forward to enjoy and be challenged with.

I'm grateful for all your hard work despite a time of uncertainty for all of us.  Thanks for all you do and everything you stand for as cadets, students  and as individuals.  As Colonel Tucker said to all of you before we left school.  Be grateful for life and all that it throws at you (albeit good or bad).  Embrace our loved ones, stay positive and make the best of your time while away from school.

Stay in touch (via social media) with family and friends and try to make these tumultuous times as normal as possible.

All of you need to be back at school as soon as it’s safe to do so and when that time comes, Colonel Tucker and myself will do everything we can to make it the best, enriching and most memorable last few months of our school year!

Students first, ALWAYS!
