Happy Sunday Everyone!!

I have great news that you all probably have heard already.
Our Academic Team recently went to JLAB in Washington DC and won the National Competition against all service JROTC programs. They brought home the gold for the 3rd time in a row!!

Congratulation Academic Team! Thank you everyone else for watching the live streams and supporting them!

See you all later and have a great rest of summer ^^
