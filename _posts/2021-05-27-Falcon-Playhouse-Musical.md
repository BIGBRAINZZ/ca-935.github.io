Hi everyone! 

Our cadets Racel Ligeralde and Abel Hurtado are going to be participating in the Falcon Playhouse's Final Musical Production of the year: Working, live in person! 

The showtimes are June 3rd and 4th at 6:30pm. The tickets are on sale right now and cost 7 dollars per device. Like the last performance, Ten/Two, a whole family can watch it from home for the cost of one ticket. You can find the playbill [here](https://sites.google.com/sandi.net/falconplayhouseplaybill/falcon-playhouse-playbill?authuser=0&fbclid=IwAR2j5pZ8P_sXjRTj-M_VsBCS2CqbSQEsnAgU2I-ERmYhjlF3qWkt9BZcvAU)
