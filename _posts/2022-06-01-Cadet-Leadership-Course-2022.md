Hello Cadets!

For the second time after the pandemic, CA-935th's Cadet Leadership Course has returned. This year it will be held between **8 - 19 August, 2022** in our very own grinder. 

Attached are the permission slips you are required to sign to attend the program that will give you a chance to connect with incoming freshman and meet the upperclassmen after a long summer. 
**Please return these forms to the unit inbox no later than JUNE 8**
