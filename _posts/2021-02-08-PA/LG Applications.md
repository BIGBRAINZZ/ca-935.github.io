Hi everyone!

The PA and LG Freshman applications are out NOW! We highly suggest you apply, and take your first taste of responsibility in the corps. The applications are attached here, and in addition to that, please come to the LG/PA informational meeting THIS THURSDAY from 1330-1430 on MSgt. Toledo's Zoom code. We will be discussing application questions, what our squadrons do, and what you can do after being selected. Instructions on how to fill out the applications are on the applications.
