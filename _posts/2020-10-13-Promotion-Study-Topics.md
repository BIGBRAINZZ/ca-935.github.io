This is a message from our first sergeant!


Happy (taco) Tuesday, everyone!


It's that time of year again! Get out your Handbooks and D&C manuals, because it's about time for our **first promotion cycle of AY 2020-21**!


Our first promotion cycle for _Quarter 1 cadets_ (A, B, and C flights only) will be taking place during flight on **Thursday, 22 October**.


Below is a list of topics to study, which corresponds to the rank that you will be testing into (NOT your current rank).

Have a great rest of the week, everyone! Hope to see you all earn some new stripes and bars next Thursday!
