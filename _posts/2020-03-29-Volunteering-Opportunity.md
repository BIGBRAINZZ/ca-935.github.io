The Scripps Ranch Civic Association is looking for people with 3D printers that are willing to print headgear for masks to provide to doctors/nurses that may come into contact with COVID-19 patients. In order to recieve the printing files, you must email the SRCA at coranavirushelp@scrippsranch.org. It takes around 6 hours to print a face shield, thus every face shield printed and delivered will be worth two volunteer hours, as your printer does most of the work. In order to recieve credit for those hours, you must send a picture of your printed face shields when you drop them off at the designated address and send them to c/Capt. Michelle Resubal or any of the Senior Staff members. Please take this opportunity to help people in need!
