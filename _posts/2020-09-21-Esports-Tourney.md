The following is a message from our First Sergeant!

What's up, gamers?

A.G.A. Nation's JROTC E-Sports program is still accepting interested cadets! Here is some updated information about the program:

Our unit can fill as many 4 person teams as we want to compete in a Super Smash Bros “round robin” format. 
Ultimately, the best team from EACH school in the local tournament will advance to compete in a March Madness style bracket style competition among participating schools. The winning high school team or club will receive $1,000 in school donations from the A.G.A. Foundation! There will also be 2nd, 3rd place prizes as well as donations to the schools and students for their participation.
AND... the top JROTC unit that invites and encourages other 4 person student teams from their school, will receive a $500 donation to their program!

If you are interested and have not gotten in contact with me, send an email to philipsargent005@gmail.com, or contact me directly. (13 have signed up so far)
