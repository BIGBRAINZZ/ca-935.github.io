Cadet Leaders and Parents,

Please see message and attachment from our administration.  They are asking all staff members for widest dissemination of this information.  Please post to our unit website and SM accounts as well as emailing all parents.

On Monday, April 6th, admin will make a list of students who still need to fill out the survey. We will organize the students and assign them to individual staff members to call. We will create a script so a uniform message is being utilized by the school. All staff should be available to make calls so hopefully it will be only a few students per staff member to call. Additionally, please post the attached message or link on your websites, include the link in your reminder messages to students, SRHS social media accounts (such as ASB clubs or athletics), etc. The more we can get the message out to students the better chance we will have of catching the majority of students electronically, which will eliminate the need to call multiple students on Monday. The link to the survey is: https://forms.gle/5Y7Ljm21tmjC7BYa7


Thank you!
