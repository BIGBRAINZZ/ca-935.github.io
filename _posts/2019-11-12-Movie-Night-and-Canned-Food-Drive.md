[Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xg2QYJ-BfBva6o6-aT7NCQS854y00YVSm-_wWNxI7Ew/edit?usp=sharing) is the permission slip for our movie night on the 15th. Please remember to turn it in before Friday, and don't forget your two cans. Hope to see you there!

Speaking of cans, [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m1I0TcgdhYTwnEfDP11k26mj5Msroe34/view) is the flyer for our canned food drive. Please spread the word, so we can help the needy as much as possible!
