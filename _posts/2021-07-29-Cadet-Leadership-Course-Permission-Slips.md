Hello incoming and returning cadets!


Summer is a very special time; it's time for our Cadet Leadership Course! This year, the course will be in-person and take place from August 9-20 at Scripps Ranch High School.


The opening letter, syllabus, and "what to bring" flyer are attached below. The permission slip must be signed by your parent and returned to **ca.935.ro@gmail.com** by **August 2**. 


This course is not mandatory, BUT it is a wonderful opportunity to develop leadership skills and get to know other cadets within the program. We are excited to present you this opportunity and hope to see you all there!!
