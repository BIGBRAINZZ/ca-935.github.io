Hello everyone! Our very first vSLS is drawing to a close. If you are a first year who has attended 9+ days of vSLS, you can take a promotion test to be able to advance to the next rank. If you are an upperclassman who is below c/SrA and is going to SLS for the first time, you can also promote with this test. The link to this promotion test will be released on the updates tab on the unit website(https://ca-935th.com/updates/) right after vSLS ends on Friday, 8/21. Christian will also post the link to the test in the Zoom chat during vSLS. You have until 10 pm Saturday to take the test. Good luck!
