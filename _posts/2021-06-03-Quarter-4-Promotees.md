Happy Thursday, everyone!

Congratulations to all of you who promoted in our final cycle of the year! Please come by any time up to next Wednesday to pick up your new ranks!

(Note: if you are eligible to promote with merits, you should contact myself or your flight commander before picking up ranks. You will not be issued your new ranks unless this is done first.)
