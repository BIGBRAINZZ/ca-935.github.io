This is a message from our Operations Commander! 

Good evening!

This Thursday (24 September) at 1800-2000 there is a virtual Air Force Recruiting Town Hall opportunity. Recruiters from each Air Force accessions source (AFROTC, Air Force Academy, Enlisted, Reserved & Air National Guard) will attend. Students and parents are welcome to join.
This meeting will be especially beneficial to Seniors, as the Air Force High School Scholarship Program application is open until the end of this year.

To attend the Town Hall, register in advance using [this link](https://www.zoomgov.com/meeting/register/vJIsdOqgqDMiGXFuMu5B3cpKn__zApygthw).

After registering, you will receive a confirmation email containing information about joining the Zoom meeting.

If you are interested, but cannot make the event, please contact the ASIs.
Have a great rest of your evening,

c/Maj Katherine Tat
