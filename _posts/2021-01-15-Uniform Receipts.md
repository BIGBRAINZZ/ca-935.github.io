Here's a message from Logistics CC,  c/Capt. Jacob Wong:

Hello everyone!
Friendly reminder that you have exactly 1 WEEK to turn in your Uniform Receipts into your Flight’s Google Classroom (before 1/22 at 11:59pm). You have lots of time to turn them in especially since there’s a 3-day weekend. Be sure to read ALL the directions posted in the link below. Have a restful weekend and good luck on finals!
