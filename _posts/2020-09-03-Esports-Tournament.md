Here is a message from our First Sargeant about a new opportunity for you! 

Happy Thursday, everyone!
A.G.A. Nation is providing two opportunities for high schools and JROTC units across the country to participate in E-Sports and Gaming activities and tournaments!

A.G.A. Nation is holding region-wide E-Sports tournaments supporting JROTC programs across the United States:

-ESPORTS competitions invite JROTC High School units across the country to compete for cash and prizes!
-The multi-week tournament invites 4 person teams from various rival high schools to compete.
-One winning team from each school then advances to take part in a region-wide tournament.
-JROTC programs that are selected and agree to serve as official hosts of their school tournament, receive donations back to their program!

Also being offered is a cinematic, mobile app experience featuring a curriculum based message: A-GAMES VIRTUAL SERIES!

Inspired by their Bring Your ‘A Game’ to School™ (BMX themed) & DUNK Distracted Driving™ (basketball themed) high school assembly programs, the A-Games Virtual Series features:

-A 25-minute digital series highlighting BOTH DUNK and BMX programs.
-A curriculum entertainment based, multiple POV camera cinematic experience, downloadable courtesy of a -revolutionary mobile app.
-First high school air date available will be January 2021!

Check out the A.G.A. Nation website for more information! Please contact me by email at philipsargent005@gmail.com if you are interested in participating in either the JROTC E-Sports program or the A-Games Virtual Series!

More information is to come if we have enough interest, so please take a look!

Have a great day, everyone!
