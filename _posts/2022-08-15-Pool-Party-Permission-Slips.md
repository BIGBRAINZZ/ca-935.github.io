Hello Cadets,
As you are aware, CLC is coming to an end this Friday which means it is time for our annual pool party. To attend, you MUST turn in a permission slip(attached below) by **August 16, 2022** to either your flight commanders or a member of Senior Staff. Please add any notes regarding dietary restrictions on the back of your permission slips. 

We wish that all of you can attend, so turn in your slips on time.
Have a great day!
