7.10.1. Hair-Female. Hair-Female. No Minimum hair length, to a maximum bulk of 4 inches from scalp and
allows proper wear of headgear. **Also, one or two braids or a single ponytail may be worn with bulk not
exceeding the width of the head and length not extending below a horizontal line running between the top of
each sleeve inseam at the under arm through the shoulder blades. Bangs, or side-swiped hair may touch
eyebrows but will not touch or cover eyes.** See Figure 3.2. When in doubt, assess correct length of hair with
Airman standing in the position of attention.

7.10.1.1. Pinned-up hair should be styled in a manner that prevents loose ends from extending upward on the
head. For example, when using a clip or hairpins, hair will not present the appearance of a rooster tail. When
hair is in a bun, the bun must be a single bun; no wider than the width of the head and all loose ends must be
tucked in and secured. **When hair is in a ponytail, it must be a single ponytail that does not extend below a
horizontal line running between the top of each sleeve inseam at the under arm through the shoulder blades.**

7.10.2. Locs, braids, twists, micro-braids, French braids, Dutch braids and cornrows are authorized. Locs are
defined as portions of hair that have been intentionally or unintentionally fused together to form a loc or
locs. A braid or twist is two or more portions of interwoven hair. If adding additional hair, it must be a natural-
looking color (similar to the individual's hair color) and conservative (moderate, being within reasonable limits; not excessive or extreme). Multiple locs, braids, twists or cornrows may come together down the back in one
or two braids or a single ponytail. Hair must not exceed bulk standard (see figure 3.2). Headgear must fit
properly.

7.10.3. All locs, braids and twists, when worn will be of uniform dimension, no wider than one inch,
with natural spacing between the locs, braids, and twists and must be tightly interwoven to present a
neat, professional and well-groomed appearance. When worn, multiple locs, braids, or twists shall be
of uniform dimension, small in diameter (approximately 1⁄4 inches), show no more than 1⁄4 inch of
scalp between the locs, braids, or twists and must be tightly interwoven to present a neat,
professional appearance.

7.10.4. A braid/twist must continue to the end of the hair without design and following the
contour of the head, and may be worn loose or in a secured style within hair standards in
paragraph 7.10.1 above. Exception: Micro-braids or twists are not required to continue to the
end of the hair.
