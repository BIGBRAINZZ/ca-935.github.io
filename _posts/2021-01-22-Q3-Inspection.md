Happy Friday everyone! I hope your finals went well.

***Quarter 3 cadets***There will be a uniform & knowledge inspection this upcoming Monday (25 Jan). Make sure you have your haircuts, shoes shined & uniforms pressed! Knowledge will be Military Time (First Years) & the Phonetic Alphabet (Upperclassmen). 

Also, don't forget there are weekly All Call Meetings every Monday at 1400! I hope to see you there.
