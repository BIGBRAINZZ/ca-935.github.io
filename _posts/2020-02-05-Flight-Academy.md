4 of our very own cadets were selected to attend the Flight Academy! Cadets Raymond Sun, Derek Phan (Primaries), Ryan Ong, and Philip Sargent (Alternates) were all chosen to recieve full ride scholarships to an aviation university, in order to obtain a private pilot's license over the summer. This scholarship is valued at about $22,500, and only 200 cadets out of 2575 were accepted, making the selection rate only 7.7%! These cadets are a true example of "excellence in all we do". Make sure to congratulate them if you see them!
