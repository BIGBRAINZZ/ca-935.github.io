As many of you may know, the recent COVID-19 crisis has caused our district's schools to close. As of now, our school will be closed from today, March 16, to at least April 6. The district has provided supplementary learning materials for you to use, [here](https://sites.google.com/sandi.net/sdusdinstructionalcontinuity/home/high-school-resources?authuser=0). Please also check this out the district's new [website](https://sites.google.com/sandi.net/covid19/) for updates on the pandemic. Stay safe out there.
