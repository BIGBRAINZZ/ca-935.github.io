Here’s a message from your APT Commander:

“Hello everyone, despite the quarantine APT is still doing TEDTalks to help you guys out especially in the new situation we’re all in. This week Cassie and Sam will be doing a presentation on how to read well, and take notes that will help you in your future studies. The next TEDTalk will be with Arvin on how to apply for colleges, so stay tuned and I hope to see everyone this Friday:)”
