The following is a message from the SNI Team concerning further drill events.

LATEST INFO REGARDING THE FUTURE DRILL EVENTS HOSTED BY SNI

In keeping with national regulations on group gatherings still in place combined with numerous school systems extending their stay closed dates until early May, SNI has made the tough but right call to cancel both the on-site and on-line NHSDTC competition. Therefore, no team events or color guard competitions will be hosted and the NHSDTC as a school championship event has been shut down for 2020. We want to congratulate those schools who worked hard all year. It is a phrase too often used but CORRECT in this instance, you are all winners for your efforts.

All students and JROTC cadets should be uplifted by school systems having the good sense to push out the date and not just reflexively cancel schools in so much of the nation. Good decisions are borne of good information and NOBODY knows what the USA or the world will look like in May. Currently the four JROTC service HQs have shut down all organized activities until further notice. We at SNI completely concur with this call. There is just too much unknown at this point to make any definitive call on yes or no to anything at any point in the future so shutting down until further notice from their perspective is the prudent call. Both the Air Force and Marine Corps JROTC HQs have asked SNI to not involve their service with anything this summer and we will honor that request. They will be plenty busy enough getting ready for the 2020-21 school year no doubt!

SNI has set an internal date of early May to pop up our periscope and see what the world looks like at that time. Many promising actions are happening across the globe that make us believe the world will be a very different and better place towards the end of April and we are very hopeful more of American will start to creep back into a more normal activity level - but again, time will tell. To all high school cadets, take your on-line classes seriously, follow all school district, service, local, state and federal guidelines in place and look for more information on future SNI events through email, the Facebook page for both the NHSDTC, Individual Drill competitions and the Nationals Drill Camp.
