Heyyy guys, I hope you are all ecstatic for the Virtual Awards Banquet tomorrow and please remember your attire! This post is about Uniform Returns, specifically for the Seniors and Non-Returning Cadets who were unable to return their uniforms during the previous specified dates.
This upcoming Tuesday (6/9), ALL Seniors will have to RETURN their Regular and Team Uniforms. This will happen at the same time when you guys are picking up your graduation diplomas. There will be a station already in place for cadets to return their uniform parts.
Attached Below is an updated document of the Uniform Return Checklist so please make sure you read ALL of it!  As well, the Uniform Items MUST BE DRY-CLEANED if possible. Most dry cleaners have been open so itâ€™s highly recommended you turn in your uniforms into the dry cleaners this Saturday (6/6) so you can get them back before Tuesday (6/9).
