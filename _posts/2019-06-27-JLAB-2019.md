Our Academic Bowl team did OUTSTANDING at JLAB 2019! Cadets Samuel Chen, Raymond Sun, Kevin Griggs and Vanessa Zhou were able to take home 1st place for Air Force Championship and 2nd place against the best team from the other JROTC branches.

Congratulations to our Academic Bowl team and thank you to those who watched the live stream and supported them!
