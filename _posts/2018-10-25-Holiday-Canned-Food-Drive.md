Dear Cadets and Parents,

It's that time of year again!  The AFJROTC's Annual Holiday Canned Food Drive will officially start on November 1st and run through November 30th.  All non-perishable and unexpired canned food can be donated to classrooms around the campus that have marked blue or red bins for collection, or you can donate directly to the JROTC Room (B-14).  All proceeds go to the local San Diego Food Bank.  Last year, with everyone's contributions, we raised over 15,000 lbs. of food for the less fortunate in our beautiful city.  Let's try and top that this year!

If you would like a bin or smaller cardboard box delivered to your classroom, please let us know and we will have them brought to your class before 1 November.

If you have any questions, please contact MSgt Toledo at extension 2422 or [ftoledo@sandi.net](mailto:ftoledo@sandi.net) or Lt Col Mike Sheldon at extension 4421 or [msheldon@sandi.net](mailto:msheldon@sandi.net)

Thanks and we look forward to another successful "giving" holiday canned food drive.
