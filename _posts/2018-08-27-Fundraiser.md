Congrats on completing your 1st day of school!!!

I have attached two flyers about upcoming events and we would love for you all to participate. These activities benefit our very own Scholarship Committee. The first flyer talks about a Potluck for SRHS AFJROTC Alumni and current cadets. The potluck will be at the Scripps Ranch Community Park @ Blue Cypress Drive. It is from 12PM - 3 PM and they want us to bring donations for the Garage Sale that will take place on 15 September (which leads to the second flyer). 
There will also be a garage sale on 15 September from 9AM - 11 AM so please visit the address posted on the second flyer. 
Most importantly, if you are interested in any of these events, please contact Vanessa at (858) 405-1395. 
Have a great 2nd day of school ;)
