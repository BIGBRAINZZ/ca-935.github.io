This is a message from Deputy Commander c/Lt. Col Samantha Scotchlas about our cadet handbook!

Good Morning Everyone!
I am so excited to announce some big news!
The 2020-2021 Cadet Handbook and Cover is updated and complete! There are more additions (ie uniform regulation and military knowledge essentials) and should be more universal!
Feel free to print out the whole handbook or just the pages you want/need to write in, highlight, mark up, etc.
We will also be posting the new Cadet Handbook to the Unit Website. Please let a Senior Staff member know if you encounter any issues!
