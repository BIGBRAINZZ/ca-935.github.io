            <p>Echo Flight Commander: Philip Sargent <br>
            philipsargent005@gmail.com<br>(314) 705-7749<br>Hi, all! My name is c/2nd Lt Philip Sargent, and I’m beyond excited to be the Echo Flight Commander for the 2019-2020 school year. As a third year cadet, I am a member of Armed Team, Academic Bowl, and Kitty Hawk Tutoring Society. Outside of our unit, I am active in my church, SRHS Swim, Academic League, National Honor Society, and Chamber Bravura. This year, my goal is to bring up new leaders and foster an environment where my cadets can grow in both their character and leadership skills. Please, don’t hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns! Again, I can’t wait for another great year in this program!

            <p>Echo Flight Sgt: Rutva Mehta <br>
            rutvajmehta@gmail.com<br>(858) 250-9640<br>Hey! I am c/TSgt Rutva Mehta and I am so eager and enthusiastic to be your Echo Flight Sergeant. It is my second year in the AFJROTC program and I couldn’t be happier. I came into the program looking for an alternative to regular P.E ... and I came out with a family. I’ve made so many friends and helped so many people and learned so much from my upperclassmen. Aside from being your Echo Flight Sergeant, I will also be your StellarXplorers sergeant with the Bravo Flight Sergeant, Marcus Velasquez. I am also a martial artist of 11 years now (so I will protect you against Abel if needed) but I will also give you a hug if that’s all you need. I have a hamster named Ricky. We both enjoy sleeping and eating and just chilling in general. I know some mediocre Spanish and just enjoy saying hola every once in a while. So I hope my averageness encourages you to keep working hard because if I can do it, you can do it. I am also open to criticism, comments, concerns questions and most importantly hugs. So if you ever have a question or just need to talk to someone or even just need a plain and simple hug, I’m your gal! ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ
