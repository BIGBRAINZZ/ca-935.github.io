            <p>Echo Flight Commander: Annie Lien <br>
            jusnguyen1@gmail.com <br>(858)-280-5021<br>Hi guys!! I am c/2d Lt Annie Lien and I will be your Echo Flight Commander for the AY 2021-2022!! This year I am currently a senior so this is going to be both my fourth year at SRHS and AFJROTC! In RO, I have been a part of the PA team, Kitty Hawk, Disaster, and Unarmed. While outside of RO, I help out my parents at our boba shop down in City Heights (Yum Yum Yo 🧋🍓🥭🍉 lol, kinda promoting and kinda not), teach young kids how to sing in a program that my friends and I started (Young Vocal Artists Association), and help lead at a Buddhist organization (Chánh Kiến GĐPT). First of all, I think that this program is truly very amazing! Not to be cliché but here, I sincerely feel as if we are a whole big family. And digging up from my past memories since my freshman year, everyone was extremely nice, and welcoming. This program has changed me for the better very much. Since I will be your Flight Commander for this school year, I'll do my very best and hopefully I could bring the same experience to you all! 🤗💛💛💛

            michaelhe2016@gmail.com<br>(858)-999-4691<br>What is up my dudes it is your bestie your right hand man your silly rabbit c/TSgt Harini Akurathi 😏😋and I am the Echo Flight Sergeant for this year! This will be my second year in AFJROTC, but my first in-person year. Like my fellow Flight Sergeants, I did my first year online, so I’m still getting used to RO, but I’m SUPER excited to do it all with you guys :]. Aside from letting school evaporate me, I do plenty of extracurriculars like competitive gymnastics, Science Olympiad, MUN, and others that I’m forgetting. In RO, I’m aiming to get more involved and join some drill and special teams. This program really has made me so much more confident in myself, both as a leader and just as a person. I’m the jock of the friend group and will give you fitness and health advice<3 so please come to me for workout questions and such! I also LOVE talking about music and dance, as well as my interests which include my favorite shows and my favorite movie (How To Train Your Dragon<3) so just. Talk to me. Because I like talking. Can’t wait to meet you guys and terrorize you!!
            <br>P.S. c/TSgt Andres Palacios’ real name is Andy Raes and he’s a NERRRRRRRRRRRRRRD</br>
