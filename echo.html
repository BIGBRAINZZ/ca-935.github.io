            <p>Echo Flight Sergeant: Christian Yoon <br>
            cky2003florida@gmail.com<br>(619) 496-2259<br>Oh! Didn’t see you there! JROTC is an amazing experience, and has helped develop me as a person so much. I personally enjoy all kinds of music, and play the piano and the beautiful instrument named the “cello”. I am involved in a string ensemble and teach the cello to peers with special needs. I also love all sports, and actively play the infatuating sport elegantly named, “tennis”. Parents, your kids are in EXCELLENT hands (hehehe), and I will do my very most best to be open, friendly, and even make them smile once or twice. Remember to take it easy and keep smiling. Oh yeah my name’s Christian by the way.
